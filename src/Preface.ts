    `This book will perhaps only be understood by those who have themselves already thought the thoughts which are expressed 
    in it--or similar thoughts. It is therefore not a text-book. Its object would be attained
    if there were one person who read it with understanding and to whom it
    afforded pleasure.`,
    `The book deals with the problems of philosophy and shows, as I believe, that the method of 
    formulating these problems rests on the misunderstanding of the logic of our language. Its whole meaning could be
    summed up somewhat as follows: What can be said at all can be said
    clearly; and whereof one cannot speak thereof one must be silent.`,
    `The book will, therefore, draw a limit to thinking, or rather--not to
    thinking, but to the expression of thoughts; for, in order to draw a limit
    to thinking we should have to be able to think both sides of this limit
    (we should therefore have to be able to think what cannot be thought).
    The limit can, therefore, only be drawn in language and what lies on
    the other side of the limit will be simply nonsense.`,
    `How far my efforts agree with those of other philosophers I will not
    decide. Indeed what I have here written makes no claim to novelty in
    points of detail; and therefore I give no sources, because it is indifferent
    to me whether what I have thought has already been thought before me
    by another.`,
    `I will only mention that to the great works of Frege and the writings
    of my friend Bertrand Russell I owe in large measure the stimulation of
    my thoughts.`,
    `If this work has a value it consists in two things. First that in it
    thoughts are expressed, and this value will be the greater the better the
    thoughts are expressed. The more the nail has been hit on the head.--
    Here I am conscious that I have fallen far short of the possible. Simply
    because my powers are insuffcient to cope with the task.--May others
    come and do it better.`,
    `On the other hand the truth of the thoughts communicated here seems
    to me unassailable and definitive. I am, therefore, of the opinion that the
    problems have in essentials been finally solved. And if I am not mistaken
    in this, then the value of this work secondly consists in the fact that it
    shows how little has been done when these problems have been solved.`
